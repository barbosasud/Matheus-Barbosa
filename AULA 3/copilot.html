        <h1>Ayrton Senna</h1>
        <p>Ayrton Senna da Silva was a Brazilian racing driver who is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time. He was born on March 21, 1960, in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and began his motorsport career in karting. Senna moved up to open-wheel racing in 1981 and won the British Formula 3 championship in 1983.</p>
        <p>Senna made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984 before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda, and Senna won his first World Championship. He won further titles in 1990 and 1991, and he was runner-up in 1989 and 1993.</p>
        <p>Senna was known for his speed, technical skill, and determination. He was particularly dominant in wet conditions, earning the nickname "Rain Master." His rivalry with Prost was one of the most intense in the sport's history.</p>
        <p>Tragically, Ayrton Senna's life was cut short when he died in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. His death had a profound impact on the sport, leading to increased safety measures in Formula One. Senna's legacy lives on, and he remains a beloved figure in Brazil and among motorsport fans worldwide.</p>
